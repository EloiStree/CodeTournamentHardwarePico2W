You can simulate an XBox with Arduino Micro or Leonardo.
But they dont support Wifi and Bluetooth is hard to add in game engine when multiplatform.

So the idea here is ti have a Pico that has Wifi and NTP to be able to to relay by UART to the Arduino.

They don't have the same voltage so we are going to use an level shifter.
